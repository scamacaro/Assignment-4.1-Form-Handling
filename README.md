# Assignment-4.1-Form-Handling
Overview
Create a new PHP login page in your Mars tourism web application with a form and JavaScript validation page that ensures that the user has entered a userid and password. Then make sure the userid and password are valid. If so, set up the login page to allow users to access an employee intranet page. They must authenticate their userid and password on the login page before they can access the employee intranet page. Be creative with the information shown on the employee intranet page. Maybe they can see some basic information, such as the number of tourists booked for the next flight and links to HR forms that release the Mars tourism company from liability if an employee steals a spaceship and goes to a different planet. The important part is that the page can only be accessed if the user has been authenticated through the login page. 

Guidelines 
1. You must use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP.

2. Create a login form that contains inputs for a userid and a password.

3. There should be JavaScript validation to ensure that a userid and a password have been entered.

4. Use a database connection to check login credentials.

5. Use the Session to store a flag if the user has successfully logged in. 

6. Create an employee intranet page that can only be accessed if the user has successfully logged in. 

7. Include thorough code comments.

8. Design a great User Experience.

Deliverable
Provide a video of you logging in and navigating between the pages in your web application, along with a demonstration that the code is working.
Provide a link to the source code in GitHub.
Projects that significantly exceed the requirements will need prior approval from the instructor and may require a code review to receive credit.
